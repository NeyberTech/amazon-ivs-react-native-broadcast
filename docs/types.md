## `ConfigurationPreset`

Amazon IVS supports two channel types. Channel type determines the allowable resolution and bitrate.

|    Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| :--------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `standard` | Multiple qualities are generated from the original input, to automatically give viewers the best experience for their devices and network conditions. Resolution can be up to `1080p` and bitrate can be up to `8.5 Mbps`. Audio is transcoded only for renditions `360p` and below; above that, audio is passed through |
|  `basic`   | Amazon IVS delivers the original input to viewers. The viewer‚Äôs video-quality choice is limited to the original input. Resolution can be up to `480p` and bitrate can be up to `1.5 Mbps`                                                                                                                                |

```ts
type ConfigurationPreset =
  | 'standardPortrait'
  | 'standardLandscape'
  | 'basicPortrait'
  | 'basicLandscape';
```

|        Value        | Description                                                   |
| :-----------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `standardPortrait`  | A preset appropriate for streaming basic content in Portrait  |
| `standardLandscape` | A preset appropriate for streaming basic content in Landscape |
|   `basicPortrait`   | A preset that is usable with the Basic channel type           |
|  `basicLandscape`   | A preset that is usable with the Basic channel type           |

| `keyframeInterval` | [`KeyframeInterval?`](#keyframeinterval) |      `1` - `5`       | iOS, Android | The keyframe interval for the output video stream                                                                                                                                           |

|  `isAutoBitrate`   |                `boolean?`                |          -           | iOS, Android | Whether the output video stream will automatically adjust the bitrate based on network conditions. Use `minBitrate` and `maxBitrate` values to specify the bounds when this value is `true` |
|    `maxBitrate`    |                `number?`                 | `100000` - `8500000` | iOS, Android | The maximum bitrate for the output video stream                                                                                                                                             |

‚ö†Ô∏è _The `width` and `height` are interrelated and thus can not be used separately._

‚ö†Ô∏è _The `width` and `height` must both be between `160` and `1920`, and the maximum total number of pixels is `2,073,600.` So the smallest size is `160x160`, and the largest is either `1080x1920` or `1920x1080`. However something like `1920x1200` would not be worked. `1280x180` however is supported._

## `KeyframeInterval`

```ts
type KeyframeInterval = 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5;
```

## `IAudioConfig`

```ts
interface IAudioConfig {
  readonly bitrate?: number;
  readonly channels?: AudioChannel;
  readonly audioSessionStrategy?: AudioSessionStrategy;
  readonly quality?: AudioQuality;
}
```

|          Key           |                           Type                            |       Range        |   Platform   | Description                                                                        |

|       `channels`       |             [`AudioChannel?`](#audiochannel)              |         -          | iOS, Android | The number of channels for the output audio stream                                 |
| `audioSessionStrategy` | [`AudioSessionStrategy?`](#audiosessionstrategy-ios-only) |         -          |     iOS      | A value representing how the broadcast session will interact with `AVAudioSession` |
|       `quality`        |         [`AudioQuality?`](#audioquality-ios-only)         |         -          |     iOS      | The quality of the audio encoding                                                  |

## `AudioChannel`

```ts
type AudioChannel = 1 | 2;
```

| Value | Description          |
| :---: | -------------------- |
|  `1`  | Mono audio channel   |
|  `2`  | Stereo audio channel |

## `AudioSessionStrategy` (iOS only)

```ts
type AudioSessionStrategy =
  | 'recordOnly'
  | 'playAndRecord'
  | 'playAndRecordDefaultToSpeaker'
  | 'noAction';
```

|              Value              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| :-----------------------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|          `recordOnly`           | Controls `AVAudioSession` completely and will set the category to `record`. There is a known issue with the `recordOnly` category and AirPods. Use `playAndRecord` category to make AirPods work |
|         `playAndRecord`         | Controls `AVAudioSession` completely and will set the category to `playAndRecord`                                                                                                                |
| `playAndRecordDefaultToSpeaker` | Controls the `AVAudioSession` completely and will set the category to `playAndRecord`. On devices with both handset and speaker, the speaker will be preferred                                   |
|           `noAction`            | Does not control `AVAudioSession` at all. If this strategy is selected, only custom audio sources will be allowed. Microphone based sources will not be returned or added by any APIs            |

‚ö†Ô∏è _AirPods do not record any audio if the `audioSessionStrategy` is set to `recordOnly`. By default, the `playAndRecord` value is used, so this issue manifests only if the value is changed to `recordOnly`._

## `AudioQuality` (iOS only)

| :----: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fit`  | Will fit the entire image within the bounding area while maintaining the correct aspect ratio. in practice this means that there will be letterboxing or pillarboxing |
| `fill` | Will fill the bounding area with the image while maintaining the aspect ratio. in practice this means that the image will likely be cropped                           |
| `none` | Will simply fill the bounding area with the image, disregarding the aspect ratio                                                                                      |

  | 'ERROR';
```

|     Value      | Description                                                                                                         |

|    [`NetworkHealth`](#networkhealth)    | Represents the current health of the network. `BAD` means the network is struggling to keep up and the broadcast may be experiencing latency spikes. The SDK may also reduce the quality of the broadcast on low values in order to keep it stable, depending on the minimum allowed bitrate in the broadcast configuration. A value of `EXCELLENT` means the network is easily able to keep up with the current demand and the SDK will be trying to increase the broadcast quality over time, depending on the maximum allowed bitrate. Values like `MEDIUM` or `LOW` are not necessarily bad, it just means the network is being saturated, but it is still able to keep up. The broadcast is still likely stable |
| [`BroadcastQuality`](#broadcastquality) | Represents the quality of the stream based on the bitrate minimum and maximum provided on session configuration. If the video configuration looks like: initial bitrate = 1000 kbps minimum bitrate = 300 kbps maximum bitrate = 5,000 kbps It will be expected that a nearMinimum quality is provided to this callback initially, since the initial bitrate is much closer to the minimum allowed bitrate than the maximum. If network conditions are good, the quality should improve over time towards nearMaximum                                                                                                                                                                                                |
