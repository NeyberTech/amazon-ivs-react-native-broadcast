# **Types**

## `ConfigurationPreset`

Amazon IVS supports two channel types. Channel type determines the allowable resolution and bitrate.

| Type | Description |
| :---: | --- |
| `standard` | Multiple qualities are generated from the original input, to automatically give viewers the best experience for their devices and network conditions. Resolution can be up to 1080p and bitrate can be up to 8.5 Mbps. Audio is transcoded only for renditions 360p and below; above that, audio is passed through |
| `basic` | Amazon IVS delivers the original input to viewers. The viewer‚Äôs video-quality choice is limited to the original input. Resolution can be up to 480p and bitrate can be up to 1.5 Mbps |

```ts
type ConfigurationPreset =
  | 'standardPortrait'
  | 'standardLandscape'
  | 'basicPortrait'
  | 'basicLandscape'
```

| Value | Description |
| :---: | --- |
| `standardPortrait` | A preset appropriate for streaming basic content in Portrait |
| `standardLandscape` | A preset appropriate for streaming basic content in Landscape |
| `basicPortrait` | A preset that is usable with the Basic channel type |
| `basicLandscape` | A preset that is usable with the Basic channel type |

## `IVideoConfig`

| Key | Type | Range | Platform | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | --- |
| `width` | `number?` | `160` - `1920` | iOS, Android | The width of the output video stream |
| `height` | `number?` | `160` - `1920` | iOS, Android | The height of the output video stream |
| `bitrate` | `number?` | `100000` - `8500000` | iOS, Android | Initial bitrate for the output video stream |
| `targetFrameRate` | `number?` | `10` - `60`| iOS, Android | The target framerate of the output video stream |
| `keyframeInterval` | `number?` | `1` - `5` | iOS, Android | The keyframe interval for the output video stream |
| `isBFrames` | `boolean?` | | iOS, Android | Whether the output video stream uses B (Bidirectional predicted picture) frames |
| `isAutoBitrate` | `boolean?` | | iOS, Android | Whether the output video stream will automatically adjust the bitrate based on network conditions. Use `minBitrate` and `maxBitrate` values to specify the bounds when this value is `true` |
| `maxBitrate` | `number?` | `100000` - `8500000` | iOS, Android | The maximum bitrate for the output video stream |
| `minBitrate` | `number?` | `100000` - `8500000` | iOS, Android | The minimum bitrate for the output video stream |

‚ö†Ô∏è _The `width` and `height` are interrelated and thus can not be used separately._

‚ö†Ô∏è _The `width` and `height` must both be between `160` and `1920`, and the maximum total number of pixels is `2,073,600.` So the smallest size is `160x160`, and the largest is either `1080x1920` or `1920x1080`. However something like `1920x1200` would not be worked. `1280x180` however is supported._

## `IAudioConfig`
| Key | Type | Range | Platform | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | --- |
| `bitrate` | `number?` | `64000` - `160000` | iOS, Android | The average bitrate for the final output audio stream |
| `channels` | [`AudioChannel?`](#audiochannel) | | iOS, Android | The number of channels for the output audio stream |
| `audioSessionStrategy` | [`AudioSessionStrategy?`](#audiosessionstrategy-ios-only) | | iOS | A value representing how the broadcast session will interact with `AVAudioSession` |
| `quality` | [`AudioQuality?`](#audioquality-ios-only) | | iOS | The quality of the audio encoding |

## `AudioChannel`

```ts
type AudioChannel = 1 | 2;
```
| Value | Description |
| :---: | --- |
| `1` | Mono audio channel |
| `2` | Stereo audio channel |

## `AudioSessionStrategy` (iOS only)

```ts
type AudioSessionStrategy = 'recordOnly' | 'playAndRecord' | 'noAction';
```
| Value | Description |
| :---: | --- |
| `recordOnly` | Controls `AVAudioSession` completely and will set the category to `record`. There is a known issue with the `recordOnly` category and AirPods. Use `playAndRecord` category to make AirPods work. |
| `playAndRecord` | Controls `AVAudioSession` completely and will set the category to `playAndRecord`. |
| `noAction` | Does not control `AVAudioSession` at all. If this strategy is selected, only custom audio sources will be allowed. Microphone based sources will not be returned or added by any APIs. |

‚ö†Ô∏è _AirPods do not record any audio if the `audioSessionStrategy` is set to `recordOnly`. By default, the `playAndRecord` value is used, so this issue manifests only if the value is changed to `recordOnly`._

## `AudioQuality` (iOS only)

```ts
type AudioQuality = 'minimum' | 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'maximum';
```

‚ö†Ô∏è _Reducing the audio `quality` can have a large impact on CPU usage._

## `LogLevel`

```ts
type LogLevel = 'debug' | 'error' | 'info' | 'warning';
```

| Value | Description |
| :---: | --- |
| `debug` | Debugging messages, potentially quite verbose |
| `error` | Error conditions and faults |
| `info` | Informational messages |
| `warning` | Warning messages |

## `CameraPreviewAspectMode`

```ts
type CameraPreviewAspectMode = 'fit' | 'fill' | 'none';
```

| Value | Description |
| :---: | --- |
| `fit` | Will fit the entire image within the bounding area while maintaining the correct aspect ratio. in practice this means that there will be letterboxing or pillarboxing |
| `fill` | Will fill the bounding area with the image while maintaining the aspect ratio. in practice this means that the image will likely be cropped |
| `none` | Will simply fill the bounding area with the image, disregarding the aspect ratio |

## `CameraPosition`

```ts
type CameraPosition = 'front' | 'back';
```

| Value | Description |
| :---: | --- |
| `front` | The input device is located on the front of the host device |
| `back` | The input device is located on the back of the host device |

## `StateStatusUnion`

```ts
type StateStatusUnion = "INVALID" | "DISCONNECTED" | "CONNECTING" | "CONNECTED" | "ERROR"
```

| Value | Description |
| :---: | --- |
| `INVALID` | The session is invalid. This is the initial state after creating a session but before starting a stream |
| `DISCONNECTED` | The session has disconnected. After stopping a stream the session should return to this state unless it has errored |
| `CONNECTING` | The session is connecting to the ingest server |
| `CONNECTED` | The session has connected to the ingest server and is currently sending data |
| `ERROR` | The session has had an error |

## `IBroadcastSessionError`

```ts
interface IBroadcastSessionError {
  readonly code: string;
  readonly type: string;
  readonly source: string;
  readonly detail: string;
  readonly isFatal: boolean;
  readonly sessionId: string;
}
```

## `IAudioStats`

| Key | Type | Range | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | --- |
| `peak` | `number?` | `-100` - `0` | Audio Peak over the time period |
| `rms` | `number?` | `-100` - `0` | Audio RMS over the time period |

A value of `-100` means silent.
